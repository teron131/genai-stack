      "page_content='Question:Embedded database to neo4j desktop\\nI&#39;m currently using `DatabaseManagementServiceBuilder` to store `neo4j` data on my local host. Is there anyway to import the data to `neo4j` desktop or any other tool for visualisation? for example by creating a `.csv` file or dumping the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how my directories look like.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst  \\r\\n![first][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond  \\r\\n![second][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nthird  \\r\\n![third][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to replace the `/data` directory in a `neo4j` desktop database with my own `/data` directory but it didn&#39;t work (`neo4j` desktop kept giving an error which was no surprise).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[enter image description here][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QLm9Z.jpg\\r\\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3EW2r.jpg\\r\\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uU9xt.jpg\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is my code for connecting\\r\\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GkIKu.png\\nAnswer:\\nLooks like it is Neo4j Browser is that you&#39;re interested in, not Neo4j Desktop. Most straightforward way is to connect Neo4j Browser to your embedded database while your app is running. But also indeed you can export whole database to a file and import it in Neo4j Browser which is connected to some other db, preferably empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Connect from Neo4j Browser in Neo4j Desktop\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have started Neo4j Embedded with these settings:\\r\\n```\\r\\n.setConfig( BoltConnector.enabled, true )`\\r\\n.setConfig(BoltConnector.encryption_level, BoltConnector.EncryptionLevel.DISABLED)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nthen you can connect to it while application is running by pointing Neo4j Browser to localhost:7687 and `No authentication` option:\\r\\n\\r\\n[![connect to db with neo4j browser in neo4j desktop][1]][1]\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Connect from Neo4j Browser in Docker Neo4j image\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have **Docker**, you can access database created by your application without application itself and without *Neo4j Desktop* installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are creating your embedded db like that:\\r\\n```\\r\\nDatabaseManagementService managementService = \\r\\n    new  DatabaseManagementServiceBuilder(new File(&quot;target/mydb&quot;).toPath())\\r\\n```\\r\\nit means database is located at `/target/mydb/` directory. It stays there even after application is stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can run a new neo4j server with this database by executing this bash command in directory with `pom.xml` once your application is stopped:\\r\\n```\\r\\nsudo docker run --rm -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -v $PWD/target/mydb/data:/data --name neo4j-1 neo4j\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI am using powershell and actual commands I execute are:\\r\\n```\\r\\n$neo4jDataDir = &#39;./target/mydb/data/&#39;\\r\\ndocker run --name neo4j-1 --rm -v $neo4jDataDir`:/data -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/qwertyuiop -d neo4j\\r\\n# Checkout what&#39;s happening:\\r\\ndocker logs neo4j-1\\r\\n# Stop server:\\r\\ndocker stop neo4j-1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce server is up and running, **Neo4j Browser** becomes available at localhost:7474 in web browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso I&#39;ve noticed when you stop server, **Neo4j Browser** keeps working until you will close it&#39;s tab in web browser.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Export database and import in Neo4j Browser\\r\\n\\r\\nIf for some reason you can&#39;t connect to your database with Neo4j Browser, you can dump your db to a file and import it afterwards in Neo4j Browser which is connected to a different db, preferably empty. For this you will need external plugin Apoc.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Add these dependencies to project:\\r\\n```\\r\\n&lt;dependency&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.neo4j.procedure&lt;/groupId&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;artifactId&gt;apoc-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;version&gt;${neo4j.version}&lt;/version&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\\r\\n&lt;dependency&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.neo4j.procedure&lt;/groupId&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;artifactId&gt;apoc-common&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;version&gt;${neo4j.version}&lt;/version&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Register procedure you will use:\\r\\n```java\\r\\n...\\r\\nGraphDatabaseService db = graphDb.database(GraphDatabaseSettings.DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME);\\r\\nregisterProcedure(db,\\r\\n\\t\\tapoc.export.cypher.ExportCypher.class);\\r\\n...\\r\\npublic static void registerProcedure(GraphDatabaseService db, Class&lt;?&gt;... procedures) {\\r\\n\\tGlobalProcedures globalProcedures = ((GraphDatabaseAPI) db).getDependencyResolver()\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t.resolveDependency(GlobalProcedures.class);\\r\\n\\tfor (Class&lt;?&gt; procedure : procedures) {\\r\\n\\t\\ttry {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tglobalProcedures.registerProcedure(procedure);\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tglobalProcedures.registerFunction(procedure);\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tglobalProcedures.registerAggregationFunction(procedure);\\r\\n\\t\\t} catch (KernelException e) {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthrow new RuntimeException(&quot;while registering &quot; + procedure, e);\\r\\n\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t}\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Enable exporting to a file:\\r\\n```java\\r\\nApocConfig.apocConfig().setProperty(ApocConfig.APOC_EXPORT_FILE_ENABLED, true);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Execute procedure:\\r\\n```java\\r\\ntry (\\r\\n\\tvar driver = GraphDatabase.driver(&quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;, AuthTokens.none());\\r\\n\\tvar session = driver.session()) {\\r\\n\\tvar query = &quot;&quot;&quot;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tCALL apoc.export.cypher.all(&quot;all-plain.cypher&quot;, {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformat: &quot;plain&quot;,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuseOptimizations: {type: &quot;UNWIND_BATCH&quot;, unwindBatchSize: 20}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t})\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t&quot;&quot;&quot;;\\r\\n\\tsession.executeRead(t -&gt; t.run(query).consume());\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Find a `./target/mydb/all-plain.cypher` text file with all your data in Cypher format.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Drag and drop it to Neo4j Browser or copy-paste it&#39;s contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nFully working example of dumping database to a file can be found [in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Podbrushkin/3f16feb9b9da22ab27ee2878c38633aa).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PHRyl.gif\\nScore:\\n0\\nLink:\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/77428848/embedded-database-to-neo4j-desktop' metadata={'a_creation_date': 1700243597, 'answer_id': 77503708, 'favorite_count': 0, 'is_accepted': True, 'link': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77428848/embedded-database-to-neo4j-desktop', 'q_creation_date': 1699247159, 'question_id': 77428848, 'reputation': 111, 'score': 0, 'source': 'stackoverflow', 'tags': 'java,neo4j', 'title': 'Embedded database to neo4j desktop'}\n",

      "Answer: Yes, you can import data to Neo4j Desktop using several methods. One common method is by using CSV files. You can create a CSV file of your data and then use the `LOAD CSV` command in Cypher to import the data. Another method is by using the Neo4j ETL tool, which allows you to import data from a relational database. You can also use the `neo4j-admin import` command for large datasets, which is faster than `LOAD CSV` but requires a specific format.\n",
